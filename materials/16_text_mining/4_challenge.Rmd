For this challenge, you will use Text Mining tools to analyze State of the Union Messages from Presidents across time. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv('data/state_ofthe_union_texts.csv')
```

Pre-process the text and answer the following questions:

1. What are corpus-specific stop words? 
2. What are the most common words across the entire corpus? What can you infer from these?
3. How do the discourses vary amongst the different presidents? And over decades?
