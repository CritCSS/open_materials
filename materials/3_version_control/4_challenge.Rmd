For this challenge, you will work in groups. 

1. Document the exercise from the practice using R Markdown and publish it into a new github repository. 

2. Add your group members as collaborators. 

3. One member of the group can create the README file, another one the .gitignore (both in the main branch).

4. Each of the members will create a new branch, modify the README file and create a new script, make a pull request and merge. Solve any conflicts that may arise.
