For this challenge, you will build a supervised learning model from the pre-processing to the predictions on the dataset. 

1.  Run a supervised learning workflow as seen on the guided and independent practice, and the feature engineering seen during the previous classes. 

2. Use one of the [Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education](https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/downloads.php) datasets, and predict the Carnegie Basic Classification. Careful! This is a raw dataset, so you will have to also look at the documentation to see the codification for the variables. 

3.  Run one Naive Bayes model and at least two KNN models with different size of K. 

4.  Which was the best model?
