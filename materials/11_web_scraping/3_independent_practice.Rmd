```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE,warning = FALSE)
```

For this independent practice, you will build a data frame that contains information about feminists across the world. You will use as input the [main page of Wikipedia about feminists.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_feminists)

1. Scrape into a dataframe all the tables that contain information about feminists. 

```{r}

```

2. Scrape from the website the links to the Wikipedia page of the feminists listed and add them as a column of the dataframe. 

```{r}

```

3. Scrape the text content of the first 50 feminists that have Wikipedia pages in the dataframe. 

```{r}

```
