For this challenge, you will address the relationship between COVID cases and poverty in US counties. 

1. Read the dataset `us_counties_covid19_daily.csv` and `SAIPE_2020.csv`, which contains information regarding estimates of poverty for 2020.

2. Explore the relationship between cases, deaths and poverty in US states. Were states with higher poverty rates more affected by COVID than others? Elaborate your hypothesis and/or conclusions.

3. Do you think other variables could affect this relationship too?
