For this challenge you can use both LDA and STM on State of the Union discourses.

```{r}

```

Pre-process the text and answer the following questions:

- How many topics can you find?
- How themes/topics evolve through time?
- Which are the main differences in themes between presidents?
- Compare the results between the topics identified with LDA and the topics identified with STM. Do you see any differences?
