```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE,warning = FALSE)
```

For this independent practice, you will work with the Gapminder dataset to predict life expectancy of countries based on other variables using a KNN model. 

1. Import the dataset and libraries you will need. 

```{r}

```

2. Split the data using a validation set approach.

```{r}

```

2. Build a linear regression model to predict life expectancy based on the other variables. 

```{r}

```

3. Assess the performance of the model.

```{r}

```

4. Build a KNN model to predict the same variable, and compare the results with the linear model. Which one had a better performance?

```{r}

```
