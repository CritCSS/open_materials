Use the CORA data set from the independent practice and make a deeper dive into it's relations:

1.  Find communities: use different community detection algorithms.\
2.  Compare network-based communities with the distribution of articles by subject. Compute the modularity of articles grouped by subject and by membership to a community. What are the differences?\
3.  Study the centrality of nodes by communities and subjects. Study the overlapping between communities and subjects.
