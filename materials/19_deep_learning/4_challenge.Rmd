For this challenge, you will build a deep learning model from the pre-processing to the test.

1.  Run a full deep learning pipeline as seen on the guided and independent practice.

2.  Instead of MNIST, use the [CIFAR100](https://keras.io/api/datasets/cifar100/) dataset. Beware that this new data has different sizes and shapes, and images are in color!

3.  Run at least 4 different models (combinations of hyper-parameters), with at least 1 FCNN and 1 CNN. Explain the procedure and the different number of trainable parameters.

4.  Which was the best model? Which hyper-parameters made the most difference?
